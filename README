I set up 2 sip2sip.info accounts with the following details
username: gargoyle
password: 98k41fh1hh
domain: sip2sip.info
Outbound Proxy:  proxy.sipthor.net

username: gargoyle2
passoword: x2w999rxaa
domain: sip2sip.info
Outbound Proxy:  proxy.sipthor.net

and an ipkall account with the 
phonenumber: 253-785-0986
that forwards to the gargoyle@sip2sip.info account.
