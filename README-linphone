					            LINPHONE ON IPHONE
					******************************************

					
BUILD PREQUISITES
*****************

Linphone for iPhone depends on liblinphone sdk. This SDK is generated from makefiles and shell scripts.
You must first install both xcode with iPhone OS SDK and MacPorts (www.macports.org) for these scripts to work.

Once xccode and macports are installed, open a terminal and install the required build-time tools with:

	$ sudo port install nawk coreutils automake autoconf libtool intltool wget pkgconfig cmake yasm doxygen


Install gas-preprosessor.pl  (http://github.com/yuvi/gas-preprocessor/ ) to be copied into /opt/local/bin :

	$ wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/yuvi/gas-preprocessor/master/gas-preprocessor.pl
	$ sudo mv gas-preprocessor.pl /opt/local/bin/.
	$ sudo chmod +x /opt/local/bin/gas-preprocessor.pl

Link macport libtoolize to glibtoolize 

	$ sudo ln -s /opt/local/bin/glibtoolize /opt/local/bin/libtoolize

Link host's strings to simulator SDK 

	$ ln -s  /usr/bin/strings /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/usr/bin/strings



BUILDING THE SDK
****************

 * GPL third parties versus non GPL third parties

This sdk can be generated in 2 flavors. Firt is with GPL third parties, it means liblinphone includes GPL third parties like FFMPEG or x264. 
If you choose this flavor, your final application must comply with GPL in any case. This is the default mode.

To generate the liblinphone multi arch sdk in GPL mode, do:
	$ cd submodules/build
	$ make all 

ALTERNATIVELY, you can force liblinphone to use only non GPL code except for liblinphone, mediastremer2, ortp, exosip, osip.
If you choose this flavor, your final application  is still subject to GPL except if you have a commercial license for liblinphone, mediastremer2, ortp, exosip, osip.

To generate the liblinphone multi arch sdkin non GPL mode, do:
	$ cd submodules/build
	$ make all enable_gpl_third_parties=no
	

The resulting sdk is in liblinphone-sdk/ directory.


In case you upgrade your IOS SDK, you may force rebuilding everything, by doing
	$ make veryclean
	$ make all

BUILDING THE APPLICATION
************************

After the SDK is built, just open the linphone xcode project with Xcode, and press "Run".

 * Note regarding third party components subject to license
 
The liblinphone-sdk is compiled with third parties code that are subject to patent license, specially: AMR, SILK and  X264 codecs.
Linphone controls the embedding of these codecs thanks to the preprocessor macros HAVE_SILK, HAVE_AMR, HAVE_X264 positioned in xcode project.
Before embeding these 3 codecs in the final application, make sure to have the right to do so.


LIMITATIONS, KNOWN BUGS
***********************

* Video capture does not work in simulator (not implemented by simulator ?).
* Sound does not work well (or at all) in simulator
