.SH NAME
ilbc \- iLBC codec for voice communication (RFC 3951 version)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B libilbc.so
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B libilbc
library.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics,
.\" respectively.
\fBiLBC (internet Low Bitrate Codec)\fP is a FREE speech codec suitable
for robust voice communication over IP.
.PP
The codec is designed for narrow band speech and results in a payload
bit rate of 13.33 kbit/s with an encoding frame length of 30 ms and
15.20 kbps with an encoding length of 20 ms. The iLBC codec enables
graceful speech quality degradation in the case of lost frames, which
occurs in connection with lost or delayed IP packets.

The source code was downloaded from http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3951.txt
