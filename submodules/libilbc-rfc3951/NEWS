Version 0.6 allows to avoid the download of the RFC, the extract script
and the license by placing copies in the ./downloads/ directory.

Now package maintainers can import existing files if they were installed
in the share or doc hierarchies.  That reduces the danger of losing
access to the source code in case the website disappears.

It also saves network bandwidth by avoiding unnecessary downloads.
