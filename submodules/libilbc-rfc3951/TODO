TODO LIST

- Include AWK script for extraction of sources into this package.

Should the script for extracting the sources ever disappear from its
current location, it would best include it with this package.

At that point, Wenyu Jiang at Columbia University should be contacted
for his permission.  His email address is wenyu@cs.columbia.edu.

To Include the script would also eliminate a potential security concern
about executing third-party software.  The package currently checks the
pertinent files for their known MD5 checksums before executing or
compiling.
