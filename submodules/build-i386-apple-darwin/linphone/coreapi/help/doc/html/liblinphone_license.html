                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of <span class="keyword">this</span> license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses <span class="keywordflow">for</span> most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free <span class="keywordflow">for</span> all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation<span class="stringliteral">&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to</span>
<span class="stringliteral">using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by</span>
<span class="stringliteral">the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to</span>
<span class="stringliteral">your programs, too.</span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral">  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</span>
<span class="stringliteral">price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</span>
<span class="stringliteral">have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</span>
<span class="stringliteral">this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it</span>
<span class="stringliteral">if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it</span>
<span class="stringliteral">in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral">  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</span>
<span class="stringliteral">anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.</span>
<span class="stringliteral">These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you</span>
<span class="stringliteral">distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral">  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</span>
<span class="stringliteral">gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that</span>
<span class="stringliteral">you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the</span>
<span class="stringliteral">source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their</span>
<span class="stringliteral">rights.</span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral">  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and</span>
<span class="stringliteral">(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,</span>
<span class="stringliteral">distribute and/or modify the software.</span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral">  Also, for each author&#39;</span>s protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty <span class="keywordflow">for</span> <span class="keyword">this</span> free
software.  If the software is modified by someone <span class="keywordflow">else</span> and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors<span class="stringliteral">&#39; reputations.</span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral">  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software</span>
<span class="stringliteral">patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free</span>
<span class="stringliteral">program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the</span>
<span class="stringliteral">program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any</span>
<span class="stringliteral">patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;</span>s free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions <span class="keywordflow">for</span> copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of <span class="keyword">this</span> General Public License.  The <span class="stringliteral">&quot;Program&quot;</span>, below,
refers to any such program or work, and a <span class="stringliteral">&quot;work based on the Program&quot;</span>
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term <span class="stringliteral">&quot;modification&quot;</span>.)  Each licensee is addressed as <span class="stringliteral">&quot;you&quot;</span>.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by <span class="keyword">this</span> License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only <span class="keywordflow">if</span> its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is <span class="keyword">true</span> depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program<span class="stringliteral">&#39;s</span>
<span class="stringliteral">source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you</span>
<span class="stringliteral">conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate</span>
<span class="stringliteral">copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the</span>
<span class="stringliteral">notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;</span>
<span class="stringliteral">and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License</span>
<span class="stringliteral">along with the Program.</span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral">You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and</span>
<span class="stringliteral">you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral">  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion</span>
<span class="stringliteral">of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and</span>
<span class="stringliteral">distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</span>
<span class="stringliteral">above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral">    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral">    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    parties under the terms of this License.</span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral">    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</span>
<span class="stringliteral">identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,</span>
<span class="stringliteral">and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</span>
<span class="stringliteral">themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</span>
<span class="stringliteral">sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</span>
<span class="stringliteral">distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</span>
<span class="stringliteral">on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</span>
<span class="stringliteral">this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</span>
<span class="stringliteral">entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</span>
<span class="stringliteral">your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</span>
<span class="stringliteral">exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</span>
<span class="stringliteral">collective works based on the Program.</span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program</span>
<span class="stringliteral">with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of</span>
<span class="stringliteral">a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</span>
<span class="stringliteral">the scope of this License.</span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral">  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,</span>
<span class="stringliteral">under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of</span>
<span class="stringliteral">Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral">    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral">    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    customarily used for software interchange; or,</span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral">    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    received the program in object code or executable form with such</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral">The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for</span>
<span class="stringliteral">making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source</span>
<span class="stringliteral">code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any</span>
<span class="stringliteral">associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to</span>
<span class="stringliteral">control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a</span>
<span class="stringliteral">special exception, the source code distributed need not include</span>
<span class="stringliteral">anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary</span>
<span class="stringliteral">form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the</span>
<span class="stringliteral">operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component</span>
<span class="stringliteral">itself accompanies the executable.</span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral">If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering</span>
<span class="stringliteral">access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent</span>
<span class="stringliteral">access to copy the source code from the same place counts as</span>
<span class="stringliteral">distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not</span>
<span class="stringliteral">compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral">  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program</span>
<span class="stringliteral">except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt</span>
<span class="stringliteral">otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is</span>
<span class="stringliteral">void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.</span>
<span class="stringliteral">However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under</span>
<span class="stringliteral">this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such</span>
<span class="stringliteral">parties remain in full compliance.</span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral">  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</span>
<span class="stringliteral">signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</span>
<span class="stringliteral">distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are</span>
<span class="stringliteral">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</span>
<span class="stringliteral">modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the</span>
<span class="stringliteral">Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</span>
<span class="stringliteral">all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</span>
<span class="stringliteral">the Program or works based on it.</span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral">  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the</span>
<span class="stringliteral">Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</span>
<span class="stringliteral">original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to</span>
<span class="stringliteral">these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</span>
<span class="stringliteral">restrictions on the recipients&#39;</span> exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible <span class="keywordflow">for</span> enforcing compliance by third parties to
<span class="keyword">this</span> License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or <span class="keywordflow">for</span> any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of <span class="keyword">this</span> License, they <span class="keywordflow">do</span> not
excuse you from the conditions of <span class="keyword">this</span> License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under <span class="keyword">this</span>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, <span class="keywordflow">if</span> a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and <span class="keyword">this</span> License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of <span class="keyword">this</span> section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of <span class="keyword">this</span> section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other <span class="keyword">property</span> right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; <span class="keyword">this</span> section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by <span class="keyword">public</span> license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide <span class="keywordflow">if</span> he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of <span class="keyword">this</span> License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under <span class="keyword">this</span> License
may add an <span class="keyword">explicit</span> geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such <span class="keywordflow">case</span>, <span class="keyword">this</span> License incorporates
the limitation as <span class="keywordflow">if</span> written in the body of <span class="keyword">this</span> License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or <span class="keyword">new</span> versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such <span class="keyword">new</span> versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address <span class="keyword">new</span> problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of <span class="keyword">this</span> License which applies to it and <span class="stringliteral">&quot;any</span>
<span class="stringliteral">later version&quot;</span>, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
<span class="keyword">this</span> License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask <span class="keywordflow">for</span> permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions <span class="keywordflow">for</span> this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM <span class="stringliteral">&quot;AS IS&quot;</span> WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a <span class="keyword">new</span> program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the <span class="keyword">public</span>, the best way to achieve <span class="keyword">this</span> is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To <span class="keywordflow">do</span> so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the <span class="stringliteral">&quot;copyright&quot;</span> line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    &lt;one line to give the program<span class="stringliteral">&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;</span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral">    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    (at your option) any later version.</span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral">    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    GNU General Public License for more details.</span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral">    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA</span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral">Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral">If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this</span>
<span class="stringliteral">when it starts in an interactive mode:</span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral">    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author</span>
<span class="stringliteral">    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;</span>.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c<span class="stringliteral">&#39; for details.</span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral">The hypothetical commands `show w&#39;</span> and `show c<span class="stringliteral">&#39; should show the appropriate</span>
<span class="stringliteral">parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may</span>
<span class="stringliteral">be called something other than `show w&#39;</span> and `show c<span class="stringliteral">&#39;; they could even be</span>
<span class="stringliteral">mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.</span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral">You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your</span>
<span class="stringliteral">school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if</span>
<span class="stringliteral">necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:</span>
<span class="stringliteral"></span>
<span class="stringliteral">  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program</span>
<span class="stringliteral">  `Gnomovision&#39;</span> (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If <span class="keyword">this</span> is what you want to <span class="keywordflow">do</span>, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of <span class="keyword">this</span> License.
