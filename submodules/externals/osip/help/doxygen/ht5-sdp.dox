/**
 * @ingroup libosip2 The GNU oSIP stack
 * @defgroup howto5_sdp How-To use the sdp negotiator (DOES NOT EXIST ANY MORE).

 * @section howto5_1 Description.

The SDP offer/answer model is where most SIP interoperability issue
comes from.  The SDP specification (rfc2327.txt) is often not fully
respected. As an example, most SIP applications forget to add the
mandatory 's' field in the SDP packet. Another mistake is to assume
that an SDP packet don't need a 'p' and a 'e' field. Even if they
are both optional, at least of those is mandatory! I have never
seen ONE implementation that send at least one 'p' or 'e' field!!

 * @section howto5_2 osip_negotiation.h VS osip_rfc3264.h

<B>The include file osip_negotiation.h and osip_rfc3264.h are
now removed from osip. You now have to do your own SDP negotiation.
If you still want to use them, please copy the code in your
application.</B>
