	* Made 20 frames the standard and changed the defined name to
	USE_20MS_FRAMES.  Also changed the documentation.

	* Added the option '--enable-20ms-frames' to configure.ac

	* Changed version number to 2.0.3

	* Made using 30ms packages optional in enc_init() with
	-DUSE_30MS_PACKAGES=1.  To that end, MSILBC_CFLAGS is now a
	precious variable in autoconf that is used in Makefile.am.

	* Deleted the old tarball for the ilbc codec that was included
	with this package.  The codec should be installed using the
	package libilbc0-rfc3951.  The dependency is being checked with
	PKG_CHECK_MODULES in configure.ac.

	* Target location for the mediastreamer plugin directory is now
	set in Makefile.am

	* Removed many older parts of configure.ac that seemed outdated,
	including machine-specific edits that are hopefully not needed
	anymore.

	* Moved m4 and build-aux helper files to subdirectories, as
	suggested by autoreconf.

	* Updated autoconf to version 2.64

	* Changed version number to 2.0.2
